# idle-timer

An event-based idle timer that emits an `idle` event after a specified period of inactivity.

## Installation

```bash
npm install idle-timer
```

## Usage

```js
import { timer } from "idle-timer";

const idle = timer(3000); // 3 seconds timeout

idle.on("idle", () => {
  console.log("User is idle");
});

// Reset timer on activity
// "idle" event is fired after 3000 msecs since active() is called,
// But if active() called again in the meantime,
// The "idle" event is postponed at 3000 msecs after the last call.
window.addEventListener("mousemove", () => idle.active());
```
