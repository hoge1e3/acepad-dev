# ace-local-commands

Add/remove session specific command in [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/).

- *Global commands*: Commands that are bound to an editor and apply to all sessions (these are the standard "commands" in Ace Editor).
- *Local commands*: Commands that are bound to individual sessions. When the session changes, the commands for the new session are activated, and the ones bound to the previous session are deactivated.  
  Local commands can override global commands. If the session changes, overridden global commands that do **not** conflict with the new session's local commands may be reactivated.

## api

- `init(editor: ace.Editor)`
   - Initializes the handler for local events.
   - This is called automatically when `addGlobalCommands` or `addLocalCommands` is used on the `editor`.
- `addGlobalCommands(editor: ace.Editor, commands: Record<string, ace.CommandLike>)`
   - Adds global `commands` to the `editor`.
   - This works similarly to `editor.addCommands`, but must be used when commands may be overridden by local commands of sessions â€” to ensure they are reactivated properly.
- `addLocalCommands(editor: ace.Editor, commands: Record<string, ace.CommandLike>)`
   - Adds `commands` to the current session of the `editor`.
- `addCommandsToSession(session: ace.EditSession, commands: Record<string, ace.CommandLike>)`
   - Adds local `commands` to a specific `session`.
   - **Note**: You must call `init(editor)` if no global/local commands have been set for the `editor`, That is, either `addGlobalCommands` or `addLocalCommands` for the `editor` is never called.
